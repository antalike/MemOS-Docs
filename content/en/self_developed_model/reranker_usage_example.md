desc: Rerank memory relevance based on the self-developed memos-reranker small model.
---

MemOS provides a memory reranking API based on the **memos-reranker** model series (including 0.6B lightweight and 4B enhanced versions, base model uses qwen-reranker post-training). Developers can directly pass a user query and a list of candidate memories to complete memory relevance reranking in one call.

## When to use memory reranking

The reranking API fits when you need:

- **Memory recall optimization**: After retrieving a large number of candidate memories, accurately filter out the memories most relevant to the current query through reranking to improve the quality of context injection.
- **Low latency at high QPS**: Based on a 0.6B small model, suitable for latency-sensitive and frequently invoked business scenarios.
- **Flexible sorting control**: Supports custom candidate document lists, can be used with any retrieval system, and does not rely on the MemOS memory store.

## How it works

The memory reranking API and interaction with the model are shown in the figure below:

The end-to-end flow of the reranking model is as follows:

1. **Query Input**  
   Developers pass in the user query (`query`) and the candidate memory document list (`documents`).

2. **Encoding & Representation**  
   After model encoding, relevance scores are output.

3. **Relevance Scoring**  
   The relevance scores are mainly divided into 5 stages as shown in the figure. Developers can set thresholds according to actual scenarios.

## Get started

::code-group
```python [Basic reranking]
import os
import requests
import json

# Replace with your MemOS API Key
os.environ["MEMOS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["MEMOS_BASE_URL"] = "https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1"

data = {
    # Available models: memos-reranker-0.6b (lightweight) or memos-reranker-4b (enhanced)
    "model": "memos-reranker-0.6b",
    "query": "Any liquor recommendations for me?",
    "documents": [
        "User prefers Jiangxiang-flavored baijiu, like Moutai.",
        "I don't drink alcohol."
    ]
}

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Token {os.environ['MEMOS_API_KEY']}"
}
url = f"{os.environ['MEMOS_BASE_URL']}/rerank"

res = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
print(f"result: {res.json()}")
```
```python [Reranking combined with memory retrieval]
import os
import requests
import json

# Replace with your MemOS API Key
os.environ["MEMOS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["MEMOS_BASE_URL"] = "https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1"

data = {
    # Available models: memos-reranker-0.6b (lightweight) or memos-reranker-4b (enhanced)
    "model": "memos-reranker-0.6b",
    "query": "What are the user's hobbies?",
    "documents": [
        "User likes playing badminton.",
        "User is a backend developer in Hangzhou.",
        "User prefers concise replies.",
        "User prefers Jiangxiang-flavored baijiu.",
        "User is going on a business trip to Beijing next Wednesday."
    ]
}

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Token {os.environ['MEMOS_API_KEY']}"
}
url = f"{os.environ['MEMOS_BASE_URL']}/rerank"

res = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
print(f"result: {res.json()}")
```

## Limits

- Maximum length of a single document: **32k tokens**.
- Maximum length of `query`: **2k tokens**.
- **Synchronous only** today: the API returns all results at once after the reranking is completed.

## Compared to Embedding Retrieval

| Dimension | Reranking API | Embedding Retrieval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core behavior | Precision ranking of candidate docs, outputting relevance scores | Semantic similarity recall, fast coarse filtering |
| Storage | ❌ Does not write to the MemOS memory store | ❌ Does not write to the MemOS memory store |
| Model | 0.6B/4B reranking models | Embedding model |
| Precision | ✅ High (cross-encoding, query-doc interaction) | General (dual-tower encoding, independent representation) |
| Speed | Slower (requires pair-by-pair computation) | ✅ Fast (vector approximate retrieval) |
| Async | Not supported | Not supported |
| Typical use | Post-retrieval precision ranking / Memory quality assessment | Fast recall from massive memory store |
