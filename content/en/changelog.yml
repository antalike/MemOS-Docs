versions:
  - name: v2.0.0
    date: 2025-12-24
    changedInfo:
      New Features:
        - type: Knowledge Base and Memory Capabilities
          changedInfo:
            - Introduced knowledge base support, enabling developers to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the long-term memory system of intelligent applications

          changedInfo:
            - Upgraded the underlying database with improved stability, connection management, and enhanced data operation performance
        - type: Scheduling Module
          changedInfo:

            - Added dynamic task priority adjustment and automatic recovery for pending tasks, significantly improving system stability and reliability (Cloud Service and Open Source)
            - Upgraded the scheduling system with multi-level isolated queues, automatic task recovery, and quota-based scheduling to ensure multi-tenant stability, guarantee zero data loss, and prioritize critical task execution (Cloud Service and Open Source)
        - type: Deployment and Engineering
          changedInfo:
            - Introduced lightweight deployment options with reduced dependency bundles, providing both quick mode and full mode deployments (Open Source)
      Bug Fixes:
        - type: Memory Scheduling and Update Tasks
          changedInfo:
            - Fixed legacy API compatibility issues in memory scheduling tasks after the MemOS framework refactor and Memcube transition to singleton mode, which previously caused legacy memory update tasks calling the old memory retrieval API to incorrectly read from the default memory database and return memories belonging to other users; this issue has been resolved to ensure proper user memory isolation
            - Fixed memory update task logging issues by limiting the number of entries returned from the Memcube working memory API, preventing excessive historical memories from obscuring newly added working memories and ensuring new entries are correctly displayed in logs
