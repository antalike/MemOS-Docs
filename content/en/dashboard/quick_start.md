title: Quick Start
desc: Welcome to the MemOS Cloud Platform. Refer to this quick start guide to easily integrate memory capabilities. You’ll need to complete the following steps.
---

## 1. Get Your API Key

Register and log in to the [MemOS Cloud Platform](https://memos-dashboard.openmem.net/quickstart). A default project will be created for you automatically. Copy the default API Key from the console.

## 2. Core Memory Operations

### 2.1 Add Original Messages

**Conversation A: Occurred on 2025-06-10**<br>
Simply provide the **raw conversation records** to MemOS.  MemOS will <code style="font-weight: bold;">automatically abstract, process, and save them as memory</code>.

::code-snippet{name=add_message}
::
```json [add_message_res.json]
{
	"code": 0,
	"data": {
		"success": true
	},
	"message": "ok"
}
```

<br>

### 2.2 Search Memory

**Conversation A: Occurred on 2025-09-28**<br>
Use the user's utterance to search memory, and MemOS will automatically retrieve the most relevant memories for the AI to reference.

> MemOS supports returning **`matches`**, **`instruction`** (coming soon), and **`full_instruction`** (coming soon). In practice, you only need to choose one according to your business needs.

> - **Need full control** → use **matches**, which only returns memory entries, and developers manually stitch them into instructions.  
> - **Want to save stitching work but still need to apply business rules** → use **instruction**, where the system has already combined memories with the user’s query into a semi-finished instruction, which developers can further refine.  
> - **Pursue one-click direct connection** → use **full_instruction**, where the system generates a complete terminal instruction that can be directly sent to the LLM.

> **Why this design**: Most memory systems stop at “recalling facts,” but facts do not equal an executable Prompt. MemOS’s unique instruction completion workflow saves you from complex stitching and fine-tuning, turning memories into prompts that the model can directly understand and execute.
