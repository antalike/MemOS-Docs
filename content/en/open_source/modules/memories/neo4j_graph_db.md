title: Graph Memory Backend
desc: "This module provides graph-based memory storage and querying for memory-augmented systems such as RAG, cognitive agents, or personal memory assistants. <br/>It defines a clean abstraction (`BaseGraphDB`) and includes a production-ready implementation using **Neo4j**."
---

## Why Graph for Memory?

Unlike flat vector stores, a graph database allows:

- Structuring memory into **chains, hierarchies, and causal links**
- Performing **multi-hop reasoning** and **subgraph traversal**
- Supporting memory **deduplication, conflict detection, and scheduling**
- Dynamically evolving a memory graph over time

This forms the backbone of long-term, explainable, and compositional memory reasoning.

## Features

- Unified interface across different graph databases
- Built-in support for Neo4j
- Support for vector-enhanced retrieval (`search_by_embedding`)
- Modular, pluggable, and testable
- [v0.2.1 New! ] Supports **multi-tenant graph memory architecture** (shared DB, per-user logic)
- [v0.2.1 New! ] Compatible with **Neo4j Community Edition** environments

## How to Use

```python
from memos.graph_dbs.factory import GraphStoreFactory
from memos.configs.graph_db import GraphDBConfigFactory

# Step 1: Build factory config
config = GraphDBConfigFactory(
    backend="neo4j",
    config={
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "user": "your_neo4j_user_name",
        "password": "your_password",
        "db_name": "memory_user1",
        "auto_create": True,
        "embedding_dimension": 768
    }
)

# Step 2: Instantiate the graph store
graph = GraphStoreFactory.from_config(config)

# Step 3: Add memory
graph.add_node(
    id="node-001",
    memory="Today I learned about retrieval-augmented generation.",
    metadata={"type": "WorkingMemory", "tags": ["RAG", "AI"], "timestamp": "2025-06-05", "sources": []}
)

## Pluggable Design

### Interface: `BaseGraphDB`

````
Function Introduction:
1. Node Operations:
   Insert: add_node (Adds a single node)
           add_nodes_batch (Adds multiple nodes in batch)
   Query: get_node (Retrieves a single node)
          get_nodes (Retrieves multiple nodes)
          get_memory_count (Retrieves the count of nodes)
          node_not_exist (Checks if a node exists)
          search_by_embedding (Vector search supports adding filter conditions for filtering. For usage of the filter, refer to the function neo4j_example.example_complex_shared_db_search_filter for the complete method documentation.)
   Update: update_node (Updates a single node)
   Delete: delete_node (Deletes a single node)
           clear(deletes all associated nodes by the user_name attribute.)
           See neo4j_example.example_complex_shared_db_delete_memory for full method docs

2. Edge Operations:
   Insert: add_edge (Adds a triple/relation as a memory element)
   Query: get_edges (Retrieves multiple relations/edges)
          edge_exists (Checks if a relation/edge exists)
          get_children_with_embeddings (Retrieves a list of child nodes for the PARENT relation type)
          get_subgraph (Queries multi-hop nodes/retrieves a subgraph)
   Delete: delete_edge (Deletes a relation/edge)

3. Import/Export Operations:
   import_graph (Imports an entire graph from a serialized dictionary. Parameters: A dictionary containing all nodes and edges to load, format: {'nodes': [], 'edges': []})
   export_graph (Exports all graph nodes and edges in a structured format, with pagination support)

See src/memos/graph_dbs/base.py for full method docs.

| ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Neo4j   | Stable | `neo4j.py` |

## Shared DB, Multi-Tenant Support

By specifying the `user_name` field, MemOS can isolate memory graphs for multiple users in a single Neo4j database. Ideal for collaborative systems or multi-agent applications:

```python
config = GraphDBConfigFactory(
    backend="neo4j",
    config={
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "user": "neo4j",
        "password": "your_password",
        "db_name": "shared-graph",
        "user_name": "alice",
        "use_multi_db": False,
        "embedding_dimension": 768,
    },
)
```

User data is logically isolated via the `user_name` field. Filtering is handled automatically during reads, writes, and searches.

## Neo4j Community Edition Support

New backend identifier: `neo4j-community`

Usage is similar to standard Neo4j, but disables Enterprise-only features:

- ❌ No support for `auto_create` databases
- ❌ No native vector indexes (External vector library must be used, currently only Qdrant is supported)
- ✅ Enforces `user_name` logic-based isolation(Community version or username belong to the same business and do not require strong isolation)

Example configuration:

```python
config = GraphDBConfigFactory(
    backend="neo4j-community",
    config={
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "user": "neo4j",
        "password": "12345678",
        "db_name": "paper",
        "user_name": "bob",
        "auto_create": False,
        "embedding_dimension": 768,
        "use_multi_db": False,
        "vec_config": {
            "backend": "qdrant",
            "config": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 6333,
                "collection_name": "neo4j_vec_db",
                "vector_dimension": 768,
                "distance_metric": "cosine"
            },
        },
    },
)
```

## Extending

You can add support for any other graph engine (e.g., **TigerGraph**, **DGraph**, **Weaviate hybrid**) by:

1. Subclassing `BaseGraphDB`
2. Creating a config dataclass (e.g., `DgraphConfig`)
3. Registering it in:

   * `GraphDBConfigFactory.backend_to_class`
   * `GraphStoreFactory.backend_to_class`

See `src/memos/graph_dbs/neo4j.py` as a reference for implementation.
