## 1. Create a New Project

*   Each new user has a "Default Project" by default.
    
*   When creating a new project via the console, enter a name and description to create your independent project.

## 2. Delete a Project

*   When you have multiple projects, you can delete projects that are no longer needed.

Deleting a project will clear all memories, messages, and related data under that project. This operation is **irreversible**.

*   Switch projects in the top left corner of the console to view the corresponding keys.
