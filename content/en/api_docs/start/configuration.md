## 1. Create a New Project

*   Each new user has a "Default Project" by default.

*   When creating a new project via the console, enter a name and description to create your independent project.

## 2. Delete a Project

*   When you have multiple projects, you can delete projects that are no longer needed.

## 3. Project API Key

*   Each project has an independent list of API keys for accessing all memories, messages, and data under that project.

*   Switch projects in the top left corner of the console to view the corresponding keys.

## 5. Project Knowledge Base

*   Create a knowledge base in the console or via API, and add knowledge bases associated with this project.
